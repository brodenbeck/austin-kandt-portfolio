      <p>I've always felt a strong pull towards different forms of media, especially those that featured unique illustrative work. In pursuit of my desire to affect the same media I grew up loving, I set out studying classical illustrative techniques at the Birmingham-Bloomfield Art Center, and later the College for Creative Studies. It was here that I was exposed to graphic design and the possibilities of merging traditional techniques with today's technologies.</p>
