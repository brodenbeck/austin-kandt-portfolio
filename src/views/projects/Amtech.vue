      <h1><strong>Amtech</strong> &mdash; Innovative electronics manufacturing</h1>
      <p>
        Amtech is unique in that they are forward thinking in the way they approach the
        electronics manufacturing space by utilizing their customizable floor space to fit any
        project. They were looking for an equally unique branding solution to showcase their
        values.

      <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>
        A new brand design and identity, marketing material to get out the word, and web assets/
        illustrations for a new front facing website.

      <h2>Appealing to the Gamer Community</h2>
      <p>
        Table top gaming, such as D n’ D and Warhammer 40K, is a big deal within a niche market.
        Gamers are looking for a quality product that extends the realm of fantasy that they are
        playing in. Combining this with a clean, modern aesthetic, we were able to create an
        identity that stuck.

      <h2><strong>Telling the Story Visually</strong>&mdash; Web graphics and illustrations</h2>
      <p>
        Talking about electronics isn’t always the most accessible conversation for everyone.
        Creating visuals to help future customers understand exactly what Amtech does was crucial.

      <h2><strong>Accelerating Growth</strong>&mdash; Marketing materials</h2>
      <p>
        Simply creating the companies brand identity isn’t enough. How that brand gets put to use
        and presented to customers is even more crucial to determine the effectiveness of all that
        work. Marketing collateral was created for trade shows, conferences, and sales meetings to
        help push Amtech’s growth forward.
