      <h1><strong>Daily UI</strong>&mdash; 100 user interface designs</h1>
      <p>
        In order to continually push my design skills, I decided to take on the Daily UI challenge
        by creating for a wide range of applications, screen types, and scenarios that one would
        encounter in this industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always come at the problem from the side of the user. What are they trying to
        accomplish? Where do their eyes look first? What sort of enjoyment are they getting
        from the interaction?
