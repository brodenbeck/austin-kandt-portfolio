      <h2><strong>Ambassador Vehicles</strong>&mdash; Vehicle design</h2>
      <p>
        DDP was looking for a refresh of their downtown vehicles to be more noticeable and
        welcoming to help facilitate a better back and forth between their ambassadors and the
        people that visit downtown.

      <h2><strong>2018 Perceptions Report</strong>&mdash; Print media, infographics</h2>
      <p>
        Every year DDP collects data through surveys sent out to a diverse sample size of
        residents. I was tasked with making this data accessible and easy to digest in a 20 page
        booklet for residents and influencers.

      <p>
        DDP hosts the bulk of their events in the summer time. As such, they require tons and tons
        of signage, as well as social media graphics to promote to residents of Detroit and the
        suburbs.

        One of the largest events of the year is the downtown Detroit tree lighting ceremony.
